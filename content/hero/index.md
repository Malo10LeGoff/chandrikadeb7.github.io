I'm a French Engineering student with a passion for learning and innovating.

Outside work, I occasionally blog on [Medium](https://malolegoff.medium.comroo/), solve CTF challenges on websites such as [RootMe](https://www.root-me.org/Thalis?lang=en#ddf03826315bdf90eda93ab370e185e6) or read books about Computer Science, History and many more
